# NIST Test Vectors

[FIPS-186-4](FIPS-186-4) contains the PKCS#1 signature verification subset of
the [FIPS-186-4
tests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/dss/186-3rsatestvectors.zip)
from the [CAVP digital signature testing
program](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/digital-signatures.html). Note
that the filename is named 186-**3**rsatestvectors.zip; apparently FIPS 186-4
reuses the test vectors from FIPS 186-3.

[FIPS-186-2](FIPS-186-2) contains the PKCS#1 signature verification subset of
the [FIPS-186-2
tests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/dss/186-2rsatestvectors.zip)
from the [CAVP digital signature testing
program](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/digital-signatures.html).

[SHAVS](SHAVS) contains the [SHA Test Vectors for Hashing Byte-Oriented
Messages](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shabytetestvectors.zip)
from [Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System
(SHAVS)](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/#03).


[sha256sums.txt](sha256sums.txt) contains the SHA-256 checksums for the ZIP
files from which the test vectors were extracted.

TODO: update sha256sums.txt.
